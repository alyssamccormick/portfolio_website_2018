        <p>Hi! My name is Alyssa McCormick. I am 16 years old and I go to Cab Calloway School of the Arts where I am a digital media major. I was born in Delaware where I have lived my entire life. Ever since I was young, I have been involved in a variety of sports, with only a few that I have remained to play, being swimming, dance, and crew. Along with sports, in my free time I enjoy watching TV, sleeping, and spending time with my family. In the future I hope to travel the globe, get married, and have many children.
